# Migrating from 9.x.x to 10.x.x

## Major changes

It's fast - very fast! The Ruby shared core has been replaced by the [Rust shared core](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-reference/tree/master/rust/).

1. Ability to create and verify both [v2] and [v3] [specification] pacts
2. A bunch of new features, including the new v3 specification [matchers and generators](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-specification/tree/version-3/), XML support, binary payloads, injected provider states and more.
3. Each test is given a dedicated server and port, simplifying lifecycle events and improving isolation between tests, also allowing the possibility of parallel tests if needed (but, you probably don't)

## Breaking changes

### Consumer

* The undocumented Monkey patching support no longer exists (there is no Ruby to monkeypatch!)
* Removed public `json()` method from consumer message pact
* `pactfileWriteMode` still supports the same options, however the behaviour of `overwrite` is such now that it will overwrite the pact file _per test_, not pact run of Pact. This is because there is no longer a single long running mock server as per previous versions. Set to `merge` or leave blank for a sensible default. 
* As per the change to `pactfileWriteMode` this also means pact files should be cleared out prior to each test, to avoid extraneous interactions in a pact file.
* Array matcher currently doesn't work on query strings (see https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-reference/issues/205). However, an array with matchers is supported (see jest spec) which can be used as a workarounnd
* the `mockService` property on the `Pact` class is no longer an actual `MockService`, but supports the `baseUrl` property.
* Manually controlling the state of the mock server - such as removing interactions - has been removed.
* There is currently no support for specifying custom tls certificates in consumer Pact tests
* `Publisher` has been removed in favour of encouraging usage of the [CLI].

### Provider

N/A - the interface is completely backwards compatible.

### Messages

N/A (as per above) - However, you can now validate your metadata too!

## Basic migration

## Consumer

### `Pact` -> `Pact`

Most users should be able to upgrade the package using existing imports and things will just work™️, however you should take note of the breaking behaviour changes above.

### `Pact` -> `PactV3`

If you would like to upgrade to the latest package to take advantage of new matchers, generators etc., you'll need to make some minor changes to how you setup your tests. 

The main differences:

* There is no longer any need to setup lifecycle methods for things like `setup`, `finalize` or `writePact` - they are done automatically for you.
* You now need to wrap your assertions in an `executeTest` call.

Given the following test:

```js
describe("API Pact test", () => {
    beforeAll(() => provider.setup());
    afterEach(() => provider.verify());
    afterAll(() => provider.finalize());

    describe("getting all products", () => {
        test("products exists", async () => {

            // set up Pact interactions
            await provider.addInteraction({
                states: [{description: 'products exist'}],
                uponReceiving: 'get all products',
                withRequest: {
                    method: 'GET',
                    path: '/products'
                },
                willRespondWith: {
                    status: 200,
                    headers: {
                        'Content-Type': 'application/json; charset=utf-8'
                    },
                    body: eachLike({
                        id: "09",
                        type: "CREDIT_CARD",
                        name: "Gem Visa"
                    }),
                },
            });

            const api = new API(provider.mockService.baseUrl);

            // make request to Pact mock server
            const product = await api.getAllProducts();

            expect(product).toStrictEqual([
                {"id": "09", "name": "Gem Visa", "type": "CREDIT_CARD"}
            ]);

        });
    });
});
```        

you would re-write it as follows:

```js
describe("API Pact test", () => {
    describe("getting all products", () => {
        test("products exists", async () => {

            // set up Pact interactions
            await provider.addInteraction({
                states: [{description: 'products exist'}],
                uponReceiving: 'get all products',
                withRequest: {
                    method: 'GET',
                    path: '/products'
                },
                willRespondWith: {
                    status: 200,
                    headers: {
                        'Content-Type': 'application/json; charset=utf-8'
                    },
                    body: eachLike({
                        id: "09",
                        type: "CREDIT_CARD",
                        name: "Gem Visa"
                    }),
                },
            });

            // Need to wrap the call in execute test. The method accepts a function
            // that provides the details of the dynamic mock server
            await provider.executeTest(async (mockService) => {
                const api = new API(mockService.url);

                // make request to Pact mock server
                const product = await api.getAllProducts();

                expect(product).toStrictEqual([
                    {"id": "09", "name": "Gem Visa", "type": "CREDIT_CARD"}
                ]);
            })

        });
    });
});
```


If you were using the builder interface:

```js
const interaction = new Interaction()
    .given('I have a list of dogs')
    .uponReceiving('a request for all dogs with the builder pattern')
    .withRequest({
        method: 'GET',
        path: '/dogs',
        headers: {
        Accept: 'application/json',
        },
    })
    .willRespondWith({
        status: 200,
        headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        },
        body: {...},
    });

    return provider.addInteraction(interaction);
```

You can now simply do this:

```js
provider
    .given('a user with ID 1 exists')
    .uponReceiving('a request to get a user')
    .withRequest({
        method: 'GET',
        path: '/users/1',
    })
    .willRespondWith({
        status: 200,
        headers: { 'content-type': 'application/json' },
        body: EXPECTED_BODY,
    });
```
